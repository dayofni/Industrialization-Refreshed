# Industrialization: Refreshed

A port of [GregTech: Refreshed](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/gregtech-refreshed) for [Modern Industrialization](a).

Requires the [Athena](https://modrinth.com/mod/athena-ctm) mod to add CTM to blocks.  

(WARNING: DESIGNED WITH FABRIC 1.20.1 IN MIND.)

### To-Do:

#### Minor tweaks

1. Retexture motors and pumps.
2. (Re)colour the Wrench texture.
3. Edit Capacitor texture from GTR to fit MI resource requirements.
4. Retexture misc. items (e.g., pipe config card, wood pulp, rubber sheet)
5. Retexture energy storage units.
6. Edit item and fluid IO ports.

#### Major tweaks

1. Create new Pipe Machine Casing textures (compatible with CTM)
2. Retexture all circuit boards, circuits, and circuit components.
3. Retexture iridium machine casings.
4. Retexture reactor casings.
5. Edit Blastproof Casing to look, well, more blast-proof.

#### Pipe dreams

1. Edit the pipe / cable textures and models.
2. Get emissive textures working. (i.e., via Continuity)
3. Make all of the hot ingots consistent in shape (requires new overlays for datagen)

### Install instructions:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy this into the `/resourcepacks` folder of your Minecraft instance. 
3. Open the resourcepack through the resourcepack selection screen.

### Modpack permissions:

Go for it. That's why I made it.
